## I haven't followed coding standards

During my entire time in school none of my classes had me follow any coding standards. The premise was if the code worked then it was good enough. While it was nice to not follow any strict guidelines I realized a few bad habits. While I was working with code I ended up being messy, having multiple empty spaces, random variables, etc. The code was a nightmare to look back at.
