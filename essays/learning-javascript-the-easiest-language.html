<p>Spoiler alert, it isnâ€™t. It mostly comes from my background of different coding languages and experience. Before this course the only prior experience I had with JavaScript was when I was doing some coding problems with my friend. He knew JavaScript from his internship and was telling me how much better it is then C#, which was the only language I knew at the time.</p>

<p>However, before I even attempted to learn JavaScript, I had to learn about python for one of my capstone courses. It was great since I felt like I had more freedom in coding, no more brackets or semicolons and arrays were piece of cake.</p>

<p>Though I still missed the feel of C# and still felt a lot more comfortable with it. Once I learned JavaScript it felt like the perfect blend between the two languages. The feel of C# with so many quality-of-life improvements made me enjoy the language from the start.</p>

<h1 id="a-different-way-to-practice">A Different Way to Practice</h1>

<p>Even though I have barely started ICS 314 I cannot deny that having such a constant amount of practice problems and mandatory tutorials have been a great way to practice. Most of my previous courses either had a larger focus on lecturing and the coding problems were not consistent enough to help me hone my skill.</p>

<p>I know I should be doing practice outside of my courses, but it can be overwhelming at times and I am a lazy person. Though I need to say coding is hard and I have a lot of practice ahead of me.</p>

<h1 id="not-everything-can-be-easy">Not Everything Can Be Easy</h1>

<p>I have only practiced this language for a week, which means there still is a lot of details I need to work on. Remember how I said there were nice QOL improvements, there are a decent amount of them. As an introduction we were required to work on the JavaScript Introduction and ES6 module on the freecodecamp website. 
Now I am not master at C# and there may be some stuff I learned in the modules that may be able to be done in C#. That being said destructuring, passing functions as arguments, promises, arrow functions, and many more are all extremely new to me.</p>

<p>Yet I love the challenge and hopefully utilizing the strategies I learned I could become more efficient in not only JavaScript but C#, Python and any other language I will learn as well.</p>
